## Introduction

Task Manager API is a backend application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This project is designed to handle common task management needs, such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as retrieving task information for both individual tasks and task lists.

This application is developed with a focus on scalability, clean code architecture, and optimal performance, adhering to RESTful API best practices.
